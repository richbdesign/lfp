	<p id="trent">&quot;RMC has been a client of Lease Finance Partners for as long as I can remember. They provide our area general managers with vehicles throughout the U.S. They deliver vehicles directly to our driverâ€™s location and dispose of their existing cars with limited involvement on our part. We tell them what we want and they get it done!</p>
	<p>We also use them to finance equipment in our Pizza Huts and other restaurants. This includes our point of sales systems, ovens, furniture and any other equipment we use in our business. We send the invoices to LFP and they take it from there. One of the benefits to leasing our point of sales systems and ovens is keeping our bank lines open for new store expansion and acquisitions.</p>
	<p>We feel Lease Finance Partners has been an important partner in our growth over the years. They just make it easy.&quot;<br />

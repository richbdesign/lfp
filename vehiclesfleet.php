	<p><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong><br />

Lease payments are lower than conventional financing because you pay for only what you use. It's kind of like getting your trade in value up front. In most cases, no up front sales tax is due since we collect and pay it monthly.</p>

	<p>Leasing accounts for over 30% of all new vehicle sales each year and it is growing. Eight out of ten Fortune 500 companies lease something. Each business may have different reasons for choosing leasing over conventional financing. Some of those include a better way to fund growth, control expenses, take advantage of current tax benefits, improve cash flow, add credit lines, convenience and more.</p>

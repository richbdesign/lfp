	<h1>Leasing leadership since 1959</h1>
	<div class="column1">
	<p>The company was founded in 1959 as Bob Moore Fleet and Leasing by a prominent local auto dealer. It was one of the first independent vehicle leasing companies in the Midwest. The name was then changed to Dealers Leasing in 1970 to emphasize that it was not affiliated with a particular auto franchise, but provided lease financing for all makes of vehicles - foreign, domestic and new or used.</p>
	<p>In 1989, Dealers Leasing began offering business equipment lease financing to its existing client base, as well as new prospects. Relationships were formed with vendors, providing lease financing options for their business products. Typical types of equipment funded were telephone and computer systems, including hardware and software, photocopiers, forklifts, signage - any type of equipment business use to make or save money.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="column2">
	<p>As its business expanded across the nation, the Dealers Leasing name was changed to Lease Finance Partners (LFP). This new name more accurately describes the trusted partnership that clients, bankers and vendors have known for more than 50 years. LFP has continued the tradition of providing exceptional lease financing solutions for all kinds of business equipment and vehicles. These solutions are administered through LFP's lease finance experts and focused on supporting your company's bottom line.</p>
	<p>LFP maintains the same philosophy as in 1959: No lease is too small or too large. LFP is your partner in business and equipment leasing.</p>

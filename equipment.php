	<div class="column1">

	<p>When you are considering an equipment purchase, leasing is a better alternative to a cash purchase or conventional loan because it allows you to conserve working capital and lines of credit.</p>



	<p>At Lease Finance Partners you'll find business leasing professionals who understand business and how to finance it. We will work with you to design a lease agreement to fit your needs and provide a single finance source for your equipment.</p>



	<p>Lease office equipment, manufacturing, construction, medical, computers, software, commercial vehicles including tractors and trailers and more. If it is used in business to save or make money we can probably lease it.</p>



	<p>Whether you are an equipment manufacturer, a dealer looking for a leasing partner or a business looking for lease financing, LFP has the leasing expertise and support to help you succeed.</p>



	<p><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong><br />

Lease payments are lower than conventional financing because you pay for only what you use. It's kind of like getting your trade in value up front. In most cases, no up front sales tax is due since we collect and pay it monthly.</p>

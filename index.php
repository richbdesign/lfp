	<h1>Let LFP structure your lease today!</h1>
	<p>A big issue for small business is having enough capital to grow the business and pay for day to day operational expenses. Meeting payroll and buying inventory puts a real strain on cash. Lease financing your equipment provides your business with a source of funding that is separate from your bank, lines of credit, credit cards or cash.</p>
